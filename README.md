## Questions to answer: 

1. What variables are most related to someone considering leaving UCLA (leaveUCLA var)
2. Ideal student profile using GPA as metric
3. Which student profiles feel most at home at UCLA
4. Which variables contribute the most to academic success at UCLA
5. Can we build a model to predict a studentâ€™s estimated success at UCLA


## Things to do 

### Cleaning up Data : 
1. Consider flagging and dropping entries that seem to be systematically inaccurate responses by student - like all 1's, all 2's. 

### Outcome Variables we are considering
1. GPA - clustered categorical is hard to model
2. Leaving - Y/N so we can run a logitisic for this
